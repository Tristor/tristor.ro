<td>Tyler Duzan is a 15+ year veteran of the tech industry. He got his
start with computers at a very young age, learning his first programming
language (BASIC) at six years old. As he got older his fascination with
computers progressed into a passion for all things technology with an
emphasis on security. As part of exploring this passion he has learned a
broad range of technical skills including a deep understanding of
Windows, Linux, and networking. Tyler has begun applying his methodical
data-driven approach to decision making and strategic focus to business
problems instead of technical problems in his role as a Product Manager.
Most recently, Tyler has joined the team at ThousandEyes, part of Cisco,
to lead Agent Strategy growing the points of visibility around the world
running ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents as well as overseeing
the BGP product area.</td>

absorbing and understanding complex systems, explaining these systems in
a simple manner, and producing excellent documentation. During my career
I’ve architected, implemented, deployed, and operated everything from a

largest public Cloud in the world. I also have demonstrated success at
reaching compliance goals and building things with security in mind. My
